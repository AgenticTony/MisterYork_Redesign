=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Remove Hardcoded Credentials and Implement Secure Secret Management
Workspace: worktrees/tasks/011-remove-hardcoded-credentials-and-implement-secure-
Started: 2026-02-18

Workflow Type: simple
Rationale: Single-file security fix with no service dependencies. The task involves removing a hardcoded credential from one file and updating documentation - a straightforward change that doesn't require multiple phases or complex coordination.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Created project_index.json
- Created context.json
- Created init.sh
- Phases: 1
- Total subtasks: 4

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Secure Credential Management): 4 subtasks
  1. Remove hardcoded GITHUB_TOKEN from .auto-claude/.env file
  2. Create or update .auto-claude/.env.example with GITHUB_TOKEN documentation
  3. Create secret management documentation in .auto-claude/SECRETS.md
  4. Run secrets scan to verify no other hardcoded credentials exist

Services Involved:
- parent: The main Mr_York project's .auto-claude directory

Scope Note:
This task operates on the parent project's .auto-claude directory, not within this worktree. The worktree was created for this task but the actual changes affect the main project's configuration files.

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups: None (single phase)
- Speedup: Sequential execution required

Security Context:
- Category: Security hardening
- Severity: Medium
- Source: ideation (sec-004)
- Risk: Hardcoded secrets can be exposed through backups, shared folders, or accidental commits

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  npx auto-claude-cli run --spec 011

Or if using the Python-based auto-claude:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 011

=== SUBTASK VERIFICATION ===

Each subtask will be verified before marking complete:

Subtask 1-1: Remove hardcoded GITHUB_TOKEN
  Verification: Check that GITHUB_TOKEN is not in .env file
  Command: grep -q 'GITHUB_TOKEN' ../.auto-claude/.env

Subtask 1-2: Create .env.example
  Verification: Check .env.example exists and contains GITHUB_TOKEN docs
  Command: test -f ../.auto-claude/.env.example && grep -q 'GITHUB_TOKEN'

Subtask 1-3: Create SECRETS.md
  Verification: Check SECRETS.md documentation exists
  Command: test -f ../.auto-claude/SECRETS.md

Subtask 1-4: Security scan
  Verification: Manual review of scan results for other hardcoded secrets

=== ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA ===

- [ ] GITHUB_TOKEN removed from .auto-claude/.env
- [ ] .env.example created with documentation
- [ ] SECRETS.md created with security guidelines
- [ ] No other hardcoded credentials detected
- [ ] Security scan passes
